        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Preparation</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the sausages and mozzarella cheese into 4cm width pieces.</li>
                    <li>On a baking tray or plate, spread the panko breadcrumbs and chopped fries on opposite sides.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Method</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Arrange the sausages and mozzarella cheese sticks onto skewers. You can make mozzarella corn dogs by just using the cheese and not the sausage.</li>
                    <li>AIn a bowl, mix together your dry ingredients and slowly incorporate the milk and egg. If your batter seems too thick, add more milk in 20 ml increments. You want a thick and sticky consistency. The batter should stick to the skewers and not drip off easily. Place the mixture in a glass.</li>
                    <li>Dip your skewers into the glass of thick batter.</li>
                    <li>Remove the excess and roll in the panko breadcrumbs or chopped fries. A mixture between the two will also work well. Press the breadcrumbs and or chopped fries gently to help the coating stay on the skewers.</li>
